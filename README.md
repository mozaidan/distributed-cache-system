Distributed Cache System
A simple Java server-client project demonstrating caching of responses.

Server listens on port 5000

Client sends messages to server and receives cached or new responses

Basic in-memory cache implementation

How to run
*Compile:*
javac Cache.java Server.java Client/Client.java

*Run server:*
java Server


*Run client:*
java Client.Client


This project helps me learn Java networking and caching concepts.
